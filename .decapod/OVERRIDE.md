# OVERRIDE.md - Project-Specific Decapod Overrides

**Canonical:** OVERRIDE.md
**Authority:** override
**Layer:** Project
**Binding:** Yes (overrides embedded constitution)

---

## Summary

This file allows you to override or extend Decapod's embedded constitution for project-specific needs.

The embedded constitution (read-only, shipped with Decapod) provides the base methodology. This file lets you customize behavior without forking Decapod. Overrides are applied at runtime when agents read the constitution via `decapod docs show`.

**Keep overrides minimal** - only add what's truly specific to your project.

## How to Use

1. Find the component section below (Core, Specs, Interfaces, Methodology, Plugins, or Architecture)
2. Scroll to the specific component you want to override (e.g., `### plugins/TODO.md`)
3. Write your override content under that heading
4. Use markdown formatting for your overrides
5. Commit this file to version control

**Example:**

```markdown
### plugins/TODO.md

## Priority Levels (Project Override)

For this project, we use a 5-level priority system:
- **critical**: Production down, blocking release
- **high**: Sprint commitment, must complete this iteration
- **medium**: Backlog, next sprint candidate
- **low**: Nice-to-have, future consideration
- **idea**: Exploration, needs refinement before actionable
```

## Project-Specific Workflow Rules

### Feature Parity Update Policy

- If you change implementation status for any feature tracked in `FEATURE_PARITY.md`, update that file in the same branch.
- Do not open a PR that changes feature behavior without checking `FEATURE_PARITY.md` for needed status updates (`❌`, `🚧`, `✅`, notes, and priorities).
